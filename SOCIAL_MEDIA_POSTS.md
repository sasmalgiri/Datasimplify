### LinkedIn Post 1 — Launch Announcement

**Title:** We just launched CryptoReportKit — 71 live crypto dashboards for $0–$19/mo

---

I spent months building what I wished existed in crypto analytics.

Most crypto data platforms charge $129–$799/month. And they still make you trust them with your API keys.

So I built CryptoReportKit — an all-in-one crypto analytics toolkit with a fundamentally different approach:

→ 71 live interactive dashboards  
→ 75+ chart widgets  
→ Built-in tax report export (Form 8949)  
→ DCA tracker & simulator  
→ **DataLab**: interactive overlays + data manipulation + research experiments  
→ **Experiment Lab**: explore live data + iterate fast in the browser  

**The biggest differentiator?** BYOK — Bring Your Own Key.

Your API keys never touch our servers. All data requests go directly from your browser to the data provider. We literally cannot see your keys.

Privacy isn't a feature. It's the architecture.

**Free tier:** 23 dashboards. No credit card. No trial countdown.  
**Pro tier:** $19/month for everything.

Compare that to:
• CoinGecko Pro — $129/mo  
• Glassnode — $799/mo  
• TradingView Premium — $599/yr

### LinkedIn Post 2 — BYOK Privacy Architecture (Thought Leadership)

---

Hot take: Most crypto analytics platforms are a privacy nightmare.

You hand them your API key. They proxy your requests through their servers. They can see every coin you track, every portfolio move you make.

When I built CryptoReportKit, I took a different approach: BYOK (Bring Your Own Key).

Here's how it works:

1. You enter your own CoinGecko API key  
2. All requests go directly from YOUR browser to CoinGecko  
3. Your key is stored in localStorage — never on our servers  
4. We never see, store, or transmit your credentials  

Why does this matter?

Because "we take your privacy seriously" is meaningless when the architecture makes surveillance the default.

Real privacy is structural. It's about making it technically impossible for us to access your data — not just promising we won't.

This is what BYOK means. Your keys. Your browser. Your data.

71 live dashboards. Zero middlemen.

### LinkedIn Post 3 — Problem/Solution (Tax Pain Point)

---

Crypto tax season is painful. I know because I lived it.

Downloading CSVs from 6 different exchanges. Manually matching buys and sells. Struggling with FIFO vs LIFO. Praying your Form 8949 doesn't trigger an audit.

So I built tax export directly into CryptoReportKit:

✅ Connect up to 6 exchanges  
✅ Automatic cost basis calculation  
✅ FIFO and LIFO methods  
✅ One-click Form 8949 CSV export  
✅ P&L dashboard with realized/unrealized gains  

No more spreadsheet gymnastics.

And it's included in the $19/mo Pro plan — not a separate $99 add-on like most platforms charge.

Free tier available with 23 dashboards → https://cryptoreportkit.com

### LinkedIn Post 4 — DataLab + Experiment Lab (The Real Differentiator)

---

Most crypto tools show you charts.

CryptoReportKit is built to help you **think** — in the browser.

Two things make it different:

1) **DataLab** — interactive chart overlays + research experiments  
Pick a coin, load a preset (confluence zones / momentum / volatility squeeze), toggle layers, tweak parameters, and iterate fast.

2) **Experiment Lab** — explore data + refine your setup  
Try different views, compare ideas, and export a clean snapshot when you’re ready.

The key is the workflow: **edit → undo → iterate → export**.

### LinkedIn Post 5 — Industry Comparison (Pricing Disruption)

---

The crypto analytics industry has a pricing problem.

Here's what you pay today:

| Platform | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| Glassnode | $799 |
| Messari | $249 |
| CoinGecko Pro | $129 |
| TradingView Premium | ~$50 |
| CryptoReportKit Pro | **$19** |

And CryptoReportKit includes:
→ 71 live dashboards  
→ Tax export (Form 8949)  
→ DCA tracker  
→ Screeners + heatmaps + comparisons  
→ BYOK privacy architecture  

No VC funding forcing us into $799/mo pricing.  
No enterprise sales team to support.  
Just useful tools at fair prices.

23 dashboards are completely free → https://cryptoreportkit.com

### X Post 1 — Launch Thread 🧵

**Tweet 1/7:**  
Just launched CryptoReportKit 🚀

71 live crypto dashboards. $19/mo. Free tier available.

Here's why I built it and why it's different from everything else out there 🧵👇

**Tweet 2/7:**  
The problem: Crypto analytics tools are either

→ Expensive ($129–$799/mo)  
→ Privacy nightmares (they see all your data)  
→ Fragmented (need 5 tools for one workflow)  

I wanted ONE platform that's affordable, private, and complete.

**Tweet 3/7:**  
The biggest innovation: BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

Your API key stays in your browser's localStorage.  
All requests go directly from YOUR browser to CoinGecko.  
We never see, store, or touch your keys.

Privacy by architecture, not by promise.

**Tweet 4/7:**  
What's included:

• 71 interactive dashboards  
• 75+ chart widgets  
• Tax export (Form 8949 CSV)  
• DCA tracker & simulator  
• Heatmaps + screeners  
• Compare + correlation views  
• 60+ currency support  

**Tweet 5/7:**  
Pricing that makes sense:

Free: 23 dashboards, no credit card  
Pro: $19/mo for everything  

Compare:  
Glassnode → $799/mo  
CoinGecko Pro → $129/mo  
Messari → $249/mo  

Not even close.

**Tweet 6/7:**  
Built with:

• Next.js 16  
• TypeScript  
• Tailwind CSS  
• Recharts + ECharts  
• Supabase  

Fully responsive. Works on mobile. Fast.

### X Post 5 — BYOK Explainer

Your crypto analytics tool can see every coin you look up.

Every portfolio position. Every watchlist. Every search.

Unless the architecture makes it impossible.

CryptoReportKit uses BYOK:
→ Your API key never leaves your browser  
→ Requests go direct to CoinGecko  
→ We CAN'T see your data

### X Post 6 — Correlation

Correlation is underrated.

If your “diversified” portfolio all moves together, your risk isn’t diversified.

Use the correlation dashboard to see which coins actually behave differently.

### X Post 9 — Tax Season

Crypto tax season tip 💡

Stop manually building your Form 8949.

CryptoReportKit exports it as a CSV with:
→ Cost basis calculated  
→ FIFO or LIFO  
→ Proceeds & gains/losses  

One click. Done.

### X Post 10 — “Daily Workflow” Post

Daily crypto workflow:
1) Heatmap → what’s moving
2) Screener → find strength/weakness
3) Compare → BTC vs ETH vs any coin
4) Sentiment → Fear & Greed context

That’s why I built CryptoReportKit.

3. **Engage with replies** within the first hour of posting  
4. **Use 3-5 hashtags** on LinkedIn, 2-3 on X
